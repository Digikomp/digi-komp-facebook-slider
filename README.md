#Digi-Komp Facebook Slider for Joomla
Tip: (edit url first before changing width and height values etc.)
Installation is straight forward if you have joomla 2.5 just unzip and install the mod_dk_fbslide_2.5 zip package, then edit the options with your settings and enable the module.
Installation is also just as straight forward if you have joomla 3.0 just unzip and install the mod_dk_fbslide_3.0 zip package, then edit the options with your settings and enable the module.
The configuration is simple but if you get stuck you can hover over the option name for a description.
